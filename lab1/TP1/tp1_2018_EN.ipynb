    "## Biking in Montreal\n",
    "Approximately 10 million tourists visit Montreal every year. Concerned in providing the best experience during their stay, the tourism department of the city has initialized the development of a new application to help the visitors meet the main touristic attractions of the city in the shortest amount of time. They discovered that, when visiting the city’s attractions, the preferred mean of transportation adopted by the tourists is the bicycle. However, since the tourists do not know the city very well, they usually struggle to create their route in order to visit the planned sights for the day. Thus, given a list of places that the tourist wants to visit, including a starting and ending location, the new application determines the itinerary that passes only once in all attractions defined by the user such that the time spent within his/her route is minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/montreal.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our job in this TP is to develop this new application. To this end, we will address the problem using three different research methods:\n",
    "1. The first methodology works by defining and exploring a search tree in order to find the route with minimum time\n",
    "2. Next, an A* algorithm will be designed to search the optimal route in this search tree more efficiently \n",
    "3. Last, a heuristic procedure will be created using the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic to optimize the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem representation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent our problem using a directed and complete graph, $G(V, A)$, where each city attraction is represented by a vertex in the set of vertices $V$, and $A$ is the set of arcs representing the bicycle path between two attractions. Each arc $a_{ij} \\in A$ has a cost $ w(a_{ij}) $ associated with the time spent on the path from attraction $i$ to attraction $j$. However, it is worth mentioning that the times are not symmetric, hence, is **not** guaranteed that $w(a_{ij}) = w(a_{ji})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user of the tool informs the list of $m$ attractions that he/she wishes to visit, $P = \\{p_1,...,p_m\\} $, where $p_1$ and $p_m$ are the starting and ending attractions, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Defining and exploring a search tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us define a search tree, $\\mathcal{T}$, where each node of this tree represents a solution $S$ that is being built. Moreover, let $V(S) \\subseteq V$ be the set of vertices already **visited** and $A(S) \\subset A$ the set of arcs already **selected**. Thus, the cost of $S$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(S) = \\sum_{a \\in A(S)} w(a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The root node of the search tree $\\mathcal{T}$ is a solution $S_{root}$ containing only the starting vertex marked as visited, i.e., $V(S_{root})=\\{p_1\\}$ and $A(S_{root}) = \\emptyset$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tree1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, children nodes are created by adding an arc from $p_1$ to every vertex $ v \\in P\\backslash V(S_{root})$. However, an arc to the ending attraction can only be added if $p_m$ is the only vertex not visited yet. We denote the new visited vertex as $c$, the current vertex of the solution, i.e., $V(S) \\gets V(S) \\cup \\{c\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tree2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, each child node similarly generates its children. For a given child solution $S$ with last added vertex $c$, we add an arc $(c, v)$ to every vertex $v \\in P\\backslash V(S)$. The constraint to add vertex $p_m$ to the solution is kept during the entire process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tree3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The leaf nodes are complete solutions, i.e., $V(S) = P$, with $p_m$ being the last attraction added to the itinerary.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The code cell below is provided to you with a function to read the graph representing the attractions of Montreal. The function $\\mathtt{read\\_graph}$ returns a numpy array object $|V|\\times |V|$ where the entry $\\mathtt{graph[i,j]}$ contains the time spent biking from attraction $i$ to attraction $j$.\n",

    "## 2. Solving with an A* algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "For our second research method, instead of enumerating all solutions, we intend to guide the search by evaluating the potential of each node of the search tree, prioritizing the solutions with lower estimate costs. To this purpose, each solution $S$ is evaluated by the heuristic function $f(S) = g(S) + h(S) $ that takes into consideration both the current cost of $S$, $g(S)$, and an estimate of the cost (lower bound), $h(S)$, to visit the ending attraction $p_m$ from $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given solution $S$, with $ c $ being the last added vertex to $V(S)$, the function $h$ could be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(S) = \\text{the shortest path from } c \\text{ to } p_m \\text{ in the graph } G_S  \\text{ induced by the set of vertices } P\\backslash V(S) \\cup \\{c\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $h(s)$ is a lower bound to the time required to the tourist to arrive at the last attraction, $p_m$, from the current attraction, $c$, passing only through attractions of $P$ still not visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we can design our A* algorithm dividing it into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As prevously done, the search tree $\\mathcal{T}$ is initialized with a root solution $S_{root}$ that contains only the starting point, i.e., $V(S_{root}) = p_1, A(S_{root}) = \\emptyset $ and $ c = p_1 $.  The cost of this initial solution is $ g(S_{root}) = 0 $. The estimative for this root solution is not important and can be discarded ($h(S_{root}) = 0 $).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select the solution $S_b$ of  $\\mathcal{T}$ that minimizes the heuristic function $f$:\n",
    "$$ f(S_b) \\leq f(S) \\quad \\forall S \\in \\mathcal{T} \\qquad S_B, S \\text{ are nodes of } \\mathcal{T} \\text{ not yet selected}$$\n",
    "Note that, at the first iteration, only the $S_{root}$ is present in $\\mathcal{T}$ and, thus, it will be selected. If $S_b$ is complete, then the optimal solution of the problem is found, and the algorithm ends. Otherwise, the algorithm proceeds normally to step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let $c$ be the last visited vertex in $S_b$. For each vertex $ v \\in P\\backslash V(S_b) $, perform the following tasks:\n",
    "  - Create a new solution $S_n$ by adding the arc $ (c, v) $ to the solution\n",
    "  - Update the sets $V(S_n)$ and $A(S_n)$;\n",
    "  - Compute $g(S_n)$ and $h(S_n)$;\n",
    "  - Insert $S_n$ as a new child node in $\\mathcal{T}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The vertex $v = p_m$ can be only added to a new solution if it is the only vertex remaining in the set $ P\\backslash V(S_b)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the selected solution $S_b$ is **complete**, i.e., $V(S_B) = P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Time to code\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first implementation task is to increment the code of the class Solution. As we shall see later, a priority queue (heap) is going to be used to implement the search tree T, instead of an ordinary queue previously used. Then, we must prepare the class Solution with a method able to compare two solutions. This is done with the method $\\_\\_\\mathtt{lt}\\_\\_\\mathtt{(self, other)}$ which must return true if $f(self) < f(other)$.\n",
    "\n",

To compute the fastest path between two vertices of a graph we can use the [Dijkstra algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) where the source node is the last added vertex, $c$. The Dijkstra algorithm can be adapted to finish as soon as the fastest path to vertex $p_m$ is found.\n",

To help in diversifying the search, the method to generate an initial solution can be randomized such that the VNS algorithm can start the search in different regions of the solution space.
